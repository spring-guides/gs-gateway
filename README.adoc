== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use this https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.5.5&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.example&artifactId=gateway&name=gateway&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.gateway&dependencies=cloud-gateway,cloud-resilience4j,cloud-contract-stub-runner[pre-initialized project] and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Gateway*, *Resilience4J*, and *Contract Stub Runner*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== Creating A Simple Route

The Spring Cloud Gateway uses routes to process requests to downstream services. In
this guide, we route all of our requests to https://httpbin.org[HTTPBin]. Routes can be configured
a number of ways, but, for this guide, we use the Java API provided
by the Gateway.

To get started, create a new `Bean` of type `RouteLocator` in `Application.java`.

`src/main/java/gateway/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
@Bean
public RouteLocator myRoutes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
    return builder.routes().build();
}
----

The `myRoutes` method takes in a `RouteLocatorBuilder` that can be used
to create routes. In addition to creating routes, `RouteLocatorBuilder` lets you add predicates and filters to your routes so that
you can route based on certain conditions as well as alter the request/response as you see fit.

Now we can create a route that routes a request to `http://httpbin.org/get` when a request is
made to the Gateway at `/get`. In our configuration of this route, we add a filter that adds the
`Hello` request header with a value of `World` to the request before it is routed:

`src/main/java/gateway/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
@Bean
public RouteLocator myRoutes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
    return builder.routes()
        .route(p -> p
            .path("/get")
            .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader("Hello", "World"))
            .uri("http://httpbin.org"))
        .build();
}
----

To test our simple Gateway, we can run `Application.java` on port `8080`.
Once the application is running, make a request to `http://localhost:8080/get`.
You can do so by using the following cURL command in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/get
----

You should receive a response back that looks similar to the following output:

[source,json]
----
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Connection": "close",
    "Forwarded": "proto=http;host=\"localhost:8080\";for=\"0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:56207\"",
    "Hello": "World",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0",
    "X-Forwarded-Host": "localhost:8080"
  },
  "origin": "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, 73.68.251.70",
  "url": "http://localhost:8080/get"
}
----

Note that HTTPBin shows that the `Hello` header with a value of `World` was sent in the request.

== Using Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker

Now we can do something a little more interesting. Since the services behind the Gateway could
potentially behave poorly and affect our clients, we might want to wrap the routes we create
in circuit breakers. You can do so in the Spring Cloud Gateway by using the Resilience4J Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker implementation.
This is implemented through a simple filter that you can add to your requests.
We can create another route to demonstrate this.

To use this filter you need to add the reactive Resilience4J CircuitBreaker dependency to your classpath.

`pom.xml`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
...
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
...
----

`build.gradle`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
...
implementation("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-reactor-resilience4j")
...
----

In the next example, we use HTTPBin's delay API, which waits a certain number of
seconds before sending a response. Since this API could potentially take a long
time to send its response, we can wrap the route that uses this API in a circuit breaker.
The following listing adds a new route to our `RouteLocator` object:

`src/main/java/gateway/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
@Bean
public RouteLocator myRoutes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
    return builder.routes()
        .route(p -> p
            .path("/get")
            .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader("Hello", "World"))
            .uri("http://httpbin.org"))
        .route(p -> p
            .host("*.circuitbreaker.com")
            .filters(f -> f.circuitBreaker(config -> config.setName("mycmd")))
            .uri("http://httpbin.org")).
        build();
}
----

There are some differences between this new route configuration and the previous one we created. For one,
we use the host predicate instead of the path predicate. This means that, as long as
the host is `circuitbreaker.com`, we route the request to HTTPBin and wrap that request in
a circuit breaker.  We do so by applying a filter to the route. We can configure the circuit breaker filter
by using a configuration object. In this example, we give the
circuit breaker a name of `mycmd`.

Now we can test this new route. To do so, we need to start the application, but, this time, we are going to make a request
to `/delay/3`. It is also important that we include a `Host` header that has a host
of `circuitbreaker.com`. Otherwise, the request is not routed. We can use the following cURL command:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl --dump-header - --header 'Host: www.circuitbreaker.com' http://localhost:8080/delay/3
----

NOTE: We use `--dump-header` to see the response headers. The `-` after `--dump-header`
tells cURL to print the headers to stdout.

After using this command, you should see the following in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout
content-length: 0
----

As you can see the circuit breaker timed out while waiting for the response from HTTPBin. When the circuit breaker times out,
we can optionally provide a fallback so that clients do not receive a `504` but something
more meaningful. In a production scenario, you might return some data from a cache, for example,
but, in our simple example, we return a response with the body `fallback` instead.

To do so, we can modify our circuit breaker filter to provide a URL to call in the case of a timeout:

`src/main/java/gateway/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
@Bean
public RouteLocator myRoutes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
    return builder.routes()
        .route(p -> p
            .path("/get")
            .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader("Hello", "World"))
            .uri("http://httpbin.org"))
        .route(p -> p
            .host("*.circuitbreaker.com")
            .filters(f -> f.circuitBreaker(config -> config
                .setName("mycmd")
                .setFallbackUri("forward:/fallback")))
            .uri("http://httpbin.org"))
        .build();
}
----

Now, when the circuit breaker wrapped route times out, it calls `/fallback` in the Gateway application.
Now we can add the `/fallback` endpoint to our application.

In `Application.java`, we add the `@RestController` class level annotation and then add the following
`@RequestMapping` to the class:

`src/main/java/gateway/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2,indent=0]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/gateway/Application.java[tag=fallback]
----

To test this new fallback functionality, restart the application and again issue the following
cURL command

[source,bash]
----
$ curl --dump-header - --header 'Host: www.circuitbreaker.com' http://localhost:8080/delay/3
----

With the fallback in place, we now see that we get a `200` back from the Gateway with the response
body of `fallback`.

[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8

fallback
----

== Writing Tests

As a good developer, we should write some tests to make sure our Gateway is doing what we
expect it should. In most cases, we want to limit our dependencies on outside resources,
especially in unit tests, so we should not depend on HTTPBin. One solution to this problem
is to make the URI in our routes configurable, so we can change the URI if we need to.

To do so, in `Application.java`, we can create a new class called `UriConfiguration`:


[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/gateway/Application.java[tag=uri-configuration]
----

To enable `ConfigurationProperties`, we need to also add a class-level annotation
to `Application.java`.

```
@EnableConfigurationProperties(UriConfiguration.class)
```

With our new configuration class in place, we can use it in the `myRoutes` method:

`src/main/java/gateway/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2,indent=0]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/gateway/Application.java[tag=route-locator]
----

Instead of hardcoding the URL to HTTPBin, we instead get the URL from our
new configuration class.

The following listing shows the complete contents of `Application.java`:

`src/main/java/gateway/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/gateway/Application.java[tag=code]
----

Now we can create a new class called `ApplicationTest` in `src/main/test/java/gateway`.
In the new class, we add the following content:

[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/test/java/gateway/ApplicationTest.java[tag=code]
----

Our test takes advantage of WireMock from Spring Cloud Contract
stand up a server that can mock the APIs from HTTPBin. The first thing to notice
is the use of `@AutoConfigureWireMock(port = 0)`. This annotation starts WireMock
on a random port for us.

Next, note that we take advantage of our `UriConfiguration` class and set the
`httpbin` property in the `@SpringBootTest` annotation to the WireMock server running locally. Within the test, we then
setup "`stubs`" for the HTTPBin APIs we call through the Gateway and mock the behavior we expect.
Finally, we use `WebTestClient` to make requests to the Gateway and validate the responses.
